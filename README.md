Torque reversal mechanism and jumping microrobot A) A photo of the microrobot next to a US dollar coin. The microrobot is made from a modified electromagnetic hinge actuator with attached legs and carbon fiber posts to hold a polymer spring. The microrobot weighs between 331 mg and 356 mg, depending on the polymer spring used, with a footprint of 20 mm by 20 mm. B) A schematic of the torque reversal mechanism and the relevant geometric parameters. The torque reversal mechanism is compromised of two equal links, each with a length of &lambda; and connected by a spring with spring constant, k. The natural length of the spring (l_0) sets the initial geometric configuration and C) The schematic of torque reversal in the jumping microrobot has three three distinct dynamical stages that occur in sequence (from left to right). First the spring is loaded, storing elastic energy, by the torque from the actuator (&tau;_a). During this stage, the torque from the spring (&tau;_s) works against the torque from the actuator (&tau;_a), while the friction torque (&tau;_f) works against the direction of motion. Then, when the line of actuation of the torque from the spring is through the pivot point, the torque from the spring is equal to zero, and the mechanism is unlatching. Finally, the torque from the spring powers the movement through spring actuation. Note that the torque from the spring reverses sign through these dynamics, but the actuator torque does not.
